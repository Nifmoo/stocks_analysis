# stocks_analysis
Analyzing stocks from certain years
# Overview
  I have used VBA to refactor a code that was not originally created to be efficient.
  I have refactored this code using arrays to shorten the processing time of of the loops.
  
 # Results
 
 I have ran this code for two years in the file, 2017 and 2018.
 These are the results

 ![VBA_Challenge_2018](https://github.com/Nifmoo/stocks_analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.PNG)
 
 Both results ran faster on my computer after refactoring the code.
 
 # Summary
  The benefits i see in refactoring this code is the run time, although minimal and the formatting of the code is not so heavy. By that i mean the code is segmented more making it more appealing to someone looking behind the curtain. It can also make it easier to follow if commented correctly. However the disadvantages i can see come from the more novice programmers. The conceptual ideas are a slightly higher level meaning the tecnical applications of such code are a little much to work into functionality. With practice, however, the novice will gain understanding and will make the code more efficient and readable.
  
  Putting the data into arrays then printing each item of the array was the most valuable part in the aspect of time saving during the refactoring. As i said above the practice of putting the original code into the array proved to be frustrating and confusing at times.
